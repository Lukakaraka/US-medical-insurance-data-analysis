# US-medical-insurance-data-analysis
I had the information about 1338 people from the US regarding their their age, sex, bmi,  number of children, smoker status, living region and medical insurance costs.
What I first did was imported the csv file and made it a dictionary, after that I made a lot of lists with the data from 
the csv file which can be used to see the differences between medical costs in different groups of people
